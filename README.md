# 🚀 Code Spark Academy

**Code Spark Academy** 
is an interactive, web-based platform designed to introduce children (ages 6-12) to the world of coding. 
The highlight of the project is **"Smart Sparkie"**, a friendly AI robot companion that answers questions, tells jokes, and teaches coding concepts in a safe, offline environment.


## ✨ Features

* **🤖 Smart Sparkie Chatbot:** An intelligent, keyword-driven bot that provides instant help with Math, Science, and Coding (Python/JS) without needing an internet connection or expensive API keys.
* **🔐 User Login System:** A simulated login interface that welcomes students by name.
* **🎨 Kid-Friendly UI:** Bright colors, large buttons, and emoji-based interactions designed for young learners.
* **⚡ High Performance:** Runs locally with zero latency since it doesn't rely on external cloud servers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Dependencies:** `body-parser`, `dotenv`, `express`

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project on your own computer:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the files):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Code_Spark_Academy.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Code_Spark_Academy.git)
    cd Code_Spark_Academy
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal/command prompt in the project folder and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4.  **Launch:**
    Open your web browser and go to:
    `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎮 How to Interact with Sparkie

Sparkie uses a "Local Logic Brain" to understand you. Try asking these commands:

* **Greetings:** "Hello", "Who are you?"
* **Coding:** "Show me Python", "How do I write a loop?", "JavaScript help"
* **Fun:** "Tell me a joke", "You are cool"
* **Math/Science:** "Do you know Math?", "Tell me about space"

Here is a professional and fun `README.md` file for **Code Spark Academy**. This is perfect for your GitHub portfolio or for showing others how to run your project.

### **How to use this:**

1. Create a new file in your project folder named **`README.md`**.
2. Copy the text below and paste it into that file.
3. (Optional) Take a screenshot of your website and save it as `screenshot.png` in your folder to replace the placeholder I left.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* [ ] Add a "Course Dashboard" where kids can track progress.
* [ ] Integrate a block-based coding game (like Scratch).
* [ ] Connect to a real LLM (Gemini/Llama) for advanced conversations (optional).

### **Next Step: Add a Screenshot**
A README looks 10x better with a picture.
1.  Run your app (`npm start`).
2.  Take a screenshot of the homepage with Sparkie talking.
3.  Name it `screenshot.png` and put it in your folder.
4.  Git will pick it up, and GitHub will display it automatically!
